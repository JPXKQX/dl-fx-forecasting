DL FX Forecasting
==============================

Python project for forecasting mid prices of different Foreign Exchange pairs.

## Run
-------------

Execute the following command to start the container:

```
docker run -it --rm jpxkqx/dl-fx-forecasting:firsttry
```

In case, the data is already in processed in the host machine, the following 
command may be more appropriate.

```
docker run -it -v "/path/to/data:/app/data" --rm jpxkqx/dl-fx-forecasting:firsttry
```

_The  path **/path/to/data** refers to the directory containing the data as 
presented in the project organization below. In case all processed information is available, it is possible to execute all scripts._


## Data

Read, load, preprocess and save the data for the currency pair EUR/USD. The ZIP files have to been in the host machine. The path to this folder must be specified as an environment vairable *PATH_RAW_DATA*. In this case, the historical data has been extracted from [True FX](https://www.truefx.com/truefx-historical-downloads/).

```
generate_datasets eur usd
```

## Visualizations

Then, plot the currency pair *EUR/USD* for the period from 25 May, 202 to 30 May, 2020.

```
plot_currency_pair eur usd H T S --period 2020-05-25 2020-05-31
```

To get the following image,

![Line plot](reports/figures/eurusd_25_30May.png "EUR/USD")

There is also the possibility to plot the cumulative distribution function using the following command

```
plot_cdf_spread eur usd --period 2020-05-17 2020-05-20
```

which gives the image shown below,

![Spread cdf](reports/figures/eurusd_spread_17_20May.png "EUR/USD")


In order to plot the distribution of the main daily statistic of the spread, the following command can be used.

```
plot_stats_spread eur usd D --period 2020-04-01 2020-06-01
```

Lastly, the correlation between the different currency pairs aggregated by any timeframe can also be plotted for any given period of time. 

```
plot_pair_correlations mid --period 2020-04-01 2020-06-01 --agg_frame H
```
